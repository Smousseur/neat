# NEAT
Experiment NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)

NEAT algorithm is a way to compute neural network by changing its topologie using genetic evolution process.

Whereas traditional neural network has a fixed topologie and adjust its neuron weights to approximate a solution, NEAT algorithm changes the weight but also the topologie itself.

As a first test, we approximate the XOR function.
It takes about 20 generations of 150 neural network to do a XOR function

Next step will be to approximate complex behavior such as human playing Mario.
